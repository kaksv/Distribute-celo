This smart contract is aimed at bringing the Concept of collective collection of funds by the members of a given group to give to one of the members of the group until the queue is complete.
In this, members are to spend a six days contributing funds to the smart contract and on the seventh day, at a specific time, the contract will dsburse the funds to one of the members based on the cretiria which s to be decided upon.
If anyone else wants to join the club, one shall pay a joining fee to the contract which will be shared as profit between the already existing members and will be added to recive after the last address in the queue.

One of the challenges to solve is comming up with an Idea on how to ensure that a participant doesnot disapper before the queue has been fully completed and everyone has had their turn and received money.
If a full round has been complete, one has an option to opt out or to stay for the next round.
